# Express Login Form
This was done as a class assignment with an open .json file with sample user access info

## To test the app:
- In terminal on the folder execute ```npm init```
- Afterwards install express by executing ```npm install express```
- Finally for rendering I used ejs so install it by executing ```npm install ejs```

Once the dependencies have been installed, run the server by executing ```node index```

- The users.json file contains few username password pairs which if used in the login form will welcome the user to the website
- Otherwise user will be prompted that the access info is not correct
